# Solution
When RAM is full the **operating** system uses an area of the hard disk drive as **virtual** memory. 

The **least** used instructions and data are swapped **out** to this area. When they are needed they are swapped back **into** the **RAM** at the expense of other data.

The advantages is that programs do not have to be **closed** but it takes longer to access the instructions from **virtual memory** than it does from **RAM**. 

Often the hard disk drive has to operate all of the time. This is noisy and is called disk **thrashing**.

# Solution
Flash memory resembles **ROM** in that it is non-volatile and **RAM** because it can be constantly erased and **written** to. 

It is made of **transistors** which retain their charge when the power is turned off. 

Flash memory is **slower** than RAM and is used in **secondary** storage devices.
